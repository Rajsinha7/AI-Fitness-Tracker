📌 Project Description

AI Fitness Tracker PRO is a computer-vision–based workout monitoring system that uses OpenCV and MediaPipe Pose Estimation to automatically detect, track, and count fitness exercises such as squats, push-ups, and bicep curls in real time.

The system smooths angle calculations with rolling averages to improve accuracy, provides live feedback on posture and reps, and generates real-time performance graphs inside a Streamlit dashboard.

Each workout session is automatically logged with timestamp, repetitions, and duration in a structured CSV file, enabling users to review progress through historical summaries and trend visualizations.

This project simulates a smart personal AI trainer — helping fitness enthusiasts track their exercise form and progress without requiring expensive wearables.
